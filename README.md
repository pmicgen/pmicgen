# LDO Code a Chip 
Automated generation of an LDO for SKY130

## Usage
To build the docker image and run it, execute `make` and open `localhost:8888` in your browser to access the Jupyter notebook.

The project provides a script to make an entire LDO based on certain specification or just certains components of it.
This script is executed in detail providing some reports inside the jupyter notebook and can serve as an example to run just the python script.
